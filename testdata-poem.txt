The rose, a symbol of passion and desire,
Its petals soft and velvety,
A splash of color, a sight to admire,
A beauty that's meant for all to see.

Its aroma sweet and intoxicating,
A fragrance that fills the air,
It's the perfect gift for one's soulmate,
A way to show your love beyond compare.

But the rose is more than just a flower,
It's a symbol of resilience and strength,
For even when its petals wilt and fade,
It still holds its grace and length.

So here's a toast to the rose,
A symbol of love that never fades,
May it bring joy and happiness,
To all who seek its beauty and aid.
