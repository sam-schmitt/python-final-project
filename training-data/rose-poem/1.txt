A rose, a symbol of love and beauty
Its petals, soft and gentle as can be
A splash of color, vibrant and true
A fragrance, sweet and pure as dew

Its stem, strong and resilient
Thorns, a reminder of life's struggles and thorns
But still it stands tall and proud
A symbol of hope, a beacon in a crowd

A rose, a testament to life's endless cycle
From bud to bloom, to wilt and fade
Yet even in death, it leaves behind a seed
To bloom anew, a timeless deed

So let us cherish and appreciate
The beauty of a rose, before it's too late
For it reminds us of the wonders of life
And all the love and joy it can bring with its light.
