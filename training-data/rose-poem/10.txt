A rose, so delicate and fair
A symbol of love, beyond compare
Its petals, soft and velvety
Its scent, a sweet and heady folly

From its stem, long and slender
It reaches up, a sight to render
As it unfurls, it reveals its charm
A splash of color, a natural balm

But beware, its thorns do show
A reminder that love can also be a blow
But the rose stands tall and proud
A symbol of beauty, that doth not shroud

So here's to the rose, so pure and true
A symbol of love, that forever grew
May it bring joy and happiness
To all who are blessed with its tenderness
