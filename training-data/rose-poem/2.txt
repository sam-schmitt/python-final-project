A rose so delicate and fair,
A symbol of love beyond compare.
With petals soft and velvety red,
It stands so tall and stands out instead.

In gardens it grows, a sight to behold,
A beauty unmatched, its story untold.
From bud to bloom, it blossoms with grace,
A natural wonder, a sight to embrace.

But beware, dear rose, for thorns do hide,
A reminder of pain that can't be denied.
Yet still it stands, a symbol of love,
A treasure to cherish, sent from above.

So here's to you, dear rose so fine,
A symbol of beauty, a gift divine.
May your petals forever unfurl,
A reminder of love, a treasure to twirl.
