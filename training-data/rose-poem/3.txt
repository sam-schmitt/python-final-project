A rose, a symbol of love and grace
A delicate flower with petals so fine
It stands tall, with its head held high
Its beauty a sight for all to admire

With its vibrant red petals and soft, fragrant scent
It captures the hearts of all who see
Its thorns a reminder of the struggles we face
But its beauty a reminder of the joy that can be

So let us all take a moment to appreciate
The simple beauty of the rose
For it is a symbol of all that is great
And a reminder of the love that grows and grows
