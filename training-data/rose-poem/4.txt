A rose, a symbol of love and beauty,
A delicate flower, a sight so pretty.
With petals soft and delicate as lace,
It's fragrance fills the air, a sweet embrace.

Red as the passion and desire within,
Or pink as the love that's pure and thin.
Yellow like the sun, bright and true,
Or white, a symbol of innocence, anew.

The thorns, a reminder of the pain of love,
But still, we cherish it, a gift from above.
For in its bloom, we find such delight,
A rose, a treasure, a beauty in sight.
