A rose so delicate and fair,
With petals soft and silky hair.
Its beauty is a sight to see,
A symbol of love and purest glee.

Its fragrance fills the air,
A sweet and gentle scent so rare.
Its colors range from pink to red,
A hue that warms the heart and head.

A rose is more than just a flower,
It is a symbol of love's sweet power.
It brings joy and happiness to all,
A gift that's precious and so small.

So let us honor this noble rose,
A treasure to be loved and chose.
For it is a symbol of love's pure light,
A beauty that shines so bright.
