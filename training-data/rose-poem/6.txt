A rose, a symbol of love and life,
A delicate flower, petals so soft and rife.

Its deep red hue, a sight so fair,
A beauty that fills the air.

A symbol of passion, of love that endures,
A rose, a symbol of hope, of a love that's pure.

It stands tall and proud, a testament to time,
A symbol of strength, of a love that's mine.

So here's to the rose, a symbol of all that's true,
A symbol of love, a symbol of you.
