A rose, a symbol of love and grace,
With petals soft and delicate,
A splash of color on its face,
A beauty that's hard to replicate.

Its aroma sweet and tantalizing,
A fragrance that fills the air,
It's the perfect gift for someone special,
A way to show you really care.

But the rose is not just beauty on the surface,
It's a symbol of strength and resilience,
For even when its petals wilt and fade,
It still holds its beauty and presence.

So here's a toast to the rose,
A symbol of love that will never die,
May it bring joy and happiness,
To all who give it a try.
