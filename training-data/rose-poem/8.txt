A rose, a symbol of love and grace
A delicate flower with beauty that can't be replaced
Its petals soft and velvety to touch
Its scent, a sweet and fragrant rush

In shades of red and pink and white
A rose is a sight to behold at first sight
It blooms in gardens and fields and parks
A symbol of beauty, love, and art

But a rose is not just a pretty face
It has thorns that can cause pain and disgrace
Yet even with these sharp and prickly parts
A rose is still loved and cherished in hearts

So let us appreciate the beauty of the rose
And all the love and joy it bestows
For it is a symbol of all that is good and true
A rose, a gift from nature, forever new
