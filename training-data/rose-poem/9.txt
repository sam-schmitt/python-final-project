A rose, a symbol of love and grace
With delicate petals, and a gentle face
Its beauty lies in its simple form
A bloom that can weather any storm

Red as the passion of a lover's kiss
Or pink as the softness of a summer's bliss
Yellow as the joy of a newborn's cry
Or white as the purity of a snowflake's sky

The thorns that surround it, they serve a purpose too
Protection from harm, a reminder of what is true
For a rose is not just a thing of beauty to behold
But a symbol of strength, a story yet untold

So let us cherish the rose, in all its hues and forms
For it is a flower that truly transforms
The world around us, with its aroma and its charm
A rose, a gift from nature's loving arms
