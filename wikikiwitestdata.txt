The edible berry of various species of woody vines in the genus Actinidia 
is known as a kiwifruit or Chinese gooseberry (commonly abbreviated to "kiwi" 
in North American, British, and continental European English). [1] [2] The Actinidia 
deliciosa "Hayward" cultivar group, which is the most popular cultivar group, [3] is 
oval and is 4.5–5.5 cm (1+34–2+14 in) in diameter and 5-8 centimeters (2–3 inches) in 
length, or about the size of a large hen's egg. It features a light green or golden 
flesh with rows of tiny, black, edible seeds and a thin, fuzzy, fibrous, tart skin 
that is light brown in color. The fruit has a delicate texture and a distinctively sweet flavor.
