An elongated, edible fruit known as a banana—which is technically a berry[1][2]—is produced 
by a variety of big herbaceous flowering plants in the genus Musa. [3] Bananas used in cooking
may be referred to as "plantains" in some nations to distinguish them from dessert bananas. 
The fruit's shape, color, and firmness vary, but it is often elongated and curved. It has soft flesh 
that is high in starch and is coated in a rind that, when mature, can be green, yellow, red, purple, 
or brown. Near the top of the plant, clusters of fruits grow upward. Musa acuminata and Musa balbisiana 
are two wild species from which almost all edible seedless (parthenocarp) bananas today are derived. 
For the hybrid Musa acuminata M, the scientific names for the majority of cultivated bananas are Musa 
acuminata, Musa balbisiana, and Musa paradisiaca.
